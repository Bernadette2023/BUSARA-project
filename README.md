**Introduction**

This project aims to address the low uptake of HIV preventive medicine (DP pills) in Kenya, implemented by the international organization JHG. Through behavioral science and data analysis, we seek to understand the factors influencing DP pill uptake and propose strategies for improvement.

**Data Understanding**
  
The dataset contains information on clients' demographics, health data, and program participation. It consists of 2213 rows and 20 columns, including client identifiers, gender, age, medical history, and DP pill status.


**Data Preparation**

The data was loaded using pandas and inspected for missing values and outliers. Data cleaning steps included filtering outliers for age, weight, and height, as well as handling missing values in the 'BP' column.

**Recommendation**

Educational campaigns are recommended to raise awareness about the benefits of DP pills. These campaigns should address misconceptions, stigma, and barriers to DP pill use. Channels such as clinics, community meetings, radio, and posters can be utilized for dissemination.

**Evaluating the Intervention**

The intervention's effectiveness should be evaluated through quantitative and qualitative methods. While an increase in DP pill uptake and refills is observed, other factors may contribute to these changes. Causality assessment is essential, and continuous monitoring is recommended.

**Insights**


The data suggests that young adults in their 20s are more receptive to the DP pill program. Targeting this demographic in educational campaigns may yield better results.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, while initial findings are promising, further assessment is needed to attribute changes in DP pill uptake to the intervention. A comprehensive evaluation approach and continuous monitoring are crucial for program improvement.
